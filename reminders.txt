which transform to use to animate div to an exact x & y coordinate, instead of transform: translateX(20px) which increases its x offset by 20px
  position: relative, then again position: abs ??



ERROR: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'transaction') at g.put
  - An issue in the library, even older versions
  - Seek yt for other libs on how to use indexedDB (very useful feature!)
